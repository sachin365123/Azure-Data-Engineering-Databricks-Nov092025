Coding Question: 

You are building a text messaging system where messages can be sent in parts due to size limitations. Each message part is tagged with a sequence number and the total number of parts. Your task is to implement a message assembler that takes an array of message parts (which may arrive in any order) and reconstructs the original message. Each message part is represented as a string in the format 'text|sequence_number|total_parts'. For example, 'Hello|1|3' means this is part 1 of a 3-part message containing the text 'Hello'. The assembled message should maintain the correct order of parts and include proper spacing between words that were split across parts.

EXAMPLE 1
Input:['Hello|1|3', 'World!|3|3', ' beautiful |2|3']

Output:Hello beautiful World!

Explanation:Three parts assembled in correct order with proper spacing

EXAMPLE 2
Input:['the last|2|2', 'This is |1|2']

Output:This is the last

Explanation:Two parts assembled in order, maintaining word spacing

Requirements
1 Implement a function that takes an array of message parts and returns the assembled message
2 Handle message parts that may arrive in any order
3 Ensure proper spacing between words when joining message parts
4 Validate that all parts of a message are present before assembly
5 Return an empty string if the message cannot be completely assembled
6 Assume each message part contains valid formatting
